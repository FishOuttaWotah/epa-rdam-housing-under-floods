Migration
* stochastic migration (not fully empirical)
* includes Alessandro's migration scheme
* utility-based migration (likely not incorporated in this model)
* post-flood migration (most likely simple)

* migration is decided top-down (so at Government level, generate number of people migrating). This possibly would be done at the areal level. the top-down method here may be a limitation for future analysis.
